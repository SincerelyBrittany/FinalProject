# FinalProject

This was an assignment required by NYCDA. It required that I finish and polish the final version of what you've been working on so far! I have my  "About Me" and "Images" pages of your personal website. I added a few pages includidng a contact me page. I made sure tocarry over the same style choices you made in the first two pages. I also made sure to  add navigation links so that everyone can navigate to and from each page easily. The final product will be your first website!
